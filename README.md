Created to use with Datto Autotask API to gather data and feed in to Power BI.

With some changes this may also work with Excel Power Query.

Shared for use but the code is mine and took some time to build up so please credit my self back.

When using take note of the comments as security for each feed does need to be correct otherwise you may have issues.

If you create any Power BI Dashboard please contact me and I will add a link as I would like the community to benifit.
